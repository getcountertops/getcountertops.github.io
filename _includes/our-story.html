<p class="h4">Step 1</p>

<p>The customer calls with information about the project they want to undertake. It is helpful if the customer can give information about the measurements of the area of the countertop, as well as the sizes and types of appliances and faucets that will go in the area of the countertop.</p>

<p class="h4">Step 2</p>

<p>We can then assist the customer in their selection of a product, color, edge profile.
The customer can come into the showroom to view countertop samples and we will work with them to find them the perfect product for their needs and budget.</p>

<p>Once the material is selected, a price estimate will be given based on the size of the project and the material used.</p>

<p class="h4">Step 3</p>

<p>We will next go to the job site and create a template of the countertop area, after which the price will be finalized.</p>

<p>Remnant pieces are available for use in smaller projects.</p>

<p class="h4">Step 4</p>

<p>At this point the countertops can be fabricated and installed. Time between choosing the material and the final installation will vary based on the size of the project.</p>
