  <p class="h4">Elizabeth's Kitchen Transformation</p>

  <p>She was still shaping her vision, but knew her firm budget. With fair, expert advise and personal service, <b>we transformed her home <em>in an unexpected way.</em></b> <br>Let me explain.</p>

  <p class="h3">Moving from your vision to finished countertops is as easy as <b>Four Steps.</b></p>

  <p class="h4"><b>Step 1:</b> Measurements, Material Choice, and Price Estimate</p>

  <p>When Elizabeth called me, she was still deciding.</p>

  <p>"I've seen some georgeous granite countertops, but this is the first time I've heard about the possabilities with quartz and solid surface," Elizabeth said.</p>

  <p><b>She said her project was unique, but when she told me what she wanted to have built I was shocked.</b></p>

  <p>"It will be a new challenge," I said, "but we will deliver."</p>

  <p><b>She gave me measurements both of the countertop area and the appliances and faucets to be installed.</b></p>

  <p>"I'll send you our <a href="{{ site.url }}/ultimate-countertop-guide">countertop guide</a> to look over," I said, "and let's meet in our showroom to view swatches."</p>

  <p>She made an appointment and was soon in our showroom. <b>She made her decision.</b></p>

  <p>"After talking with you and reading your guide, I narrowed it down to granite, quartz, and solid surface," she said, "but after seeing the natural stone, I know granite will complete my kitchen perfectly!"</p>

  <p>Later, I met with Elizabeth and her husband at one of our partner granite dealers. I gave a few pointers and they chose their granite slab.</p>

  <p>Remnant pieces are available for use in smaller projects.</p>

  <p class="h4"><b>Step 2:</b> Finalized Measurements and Price</p>

  <p>After Elizabeth chose granite, we sent her our price estimate and our team visited her home to take final measurements of the countertop area. After creating the template, we sent Elizabeth the finalized price.</p>

  <p class="h4"><b>Step 3:</b> Fabrication</p>

  <p>We fabricate all our household surfaces using the latest industry technology, including CNC Machinery to shape our quartz, quartzite and granite products.</p>

  <p class="h4"><b>Step 4:</b> Installation</p>

  <p>Time between choosing the material and the final installation will vary based on the size of the project.</p>
