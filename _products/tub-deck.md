Cultured marble is much like traditional solid surfaces, but it resembles natural marble stone and comes with a high-glossy finish.

Cultured marble is easy to clean and stain resistant. It is non-porous, so it won't draw in moisture or bacteria and does not require sealing.

Cultured marble can develop scratches and scorching, but can also be restored with polishing, which is not possible with damaged natural or engineered stone.

Cultured marble is not available for kitchen countertops.
