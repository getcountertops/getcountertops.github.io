A solid surface countertop is an acrylic-based product composed of mineral dust, resins and pigments. It is manufactured in a variety of different pattern and color combinations for a uniform, soft-matte and seamless appearance.

Solid surface has the second highest tolerance for direct heat: up to 180&deg;F / 352&deg;C. It is easy to clean and stain resistant. It is non-porous, so it won't draw in moisture or bacteria and does not require sealing.

Solid surfaces can develop scratches and scorching, but they can also be restored with polishing and sanding, which is not possible with damaged natural or engineered stone.

These countertops can be a less expensive option when compared with quartz or granite.

**Solid surface is perfect for you if you want a seamless countertop that has a uniform appearance, requires minimal maintenance, and can be restored if damaged.**
