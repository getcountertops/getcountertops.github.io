Quartzite is a metamorphic rock (a rock that has changed form under pressure/heat), which was originally pure quartz sandstone.

<b>What&rsquo;s the difference between a Quartzite Countertop and a Quartz Countertop?</b> Both contain the mineral quartz, but a quartzite countertop is a shaped and polished piece of natural stone slab. A quartz countertop, on the other hand, is an engineered stone &ndash; it is man-made using crushed quartz stone and resin.

Each quartzite countertop is one-of-a-kind, with beautiful, naturally-occurring patterns and colors. For this reason, seams will be visible, especially if the stone has veins or directional movement.

Many quartzite varieties are similar to the look of marble and do not require such careful safekeeping.

Quartzite is hard to scratch or chip and is heat resistant. The natural stone does require special maintenance. It is porous and needs to be sealed before use and resealed at least every year to prevent water damage or staining.

**Quartzite is perfect for you if you want a durable countertop with unique, natural beauty, (possibly resembling marble) and you do not mind occasional maintenance duties.**

No two stone slabs are alike. To avoid any surprises, we suggest making an appointment to view the entire slab at the stone yard to make the perfect selection.
