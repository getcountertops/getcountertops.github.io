<p class="h3">Quartz is the engineered beauty that gives you the best of both worlds.</p>

A quartz countertop is an engineered stone composed of 93% natural stone quartz and 7% resin. You get a hard, rock-like surface with the flexibility of man-made materials.

Quartz countertops can be manufactured with colors, patterns, and finishes that make them look and feel like a natural stone, including the sparkling or veining effect of granite and marble. Vibrant, modern colors are also a option. With a more uniform appearance, seams are easier to hide than in a natural stone slab. We offer custom mitered edges for quartz countertops.

Quartz is very durable; it is hard to scratch or chip and has the third highest tolerance for direct heat: up to 160&deg;F / 320&deg;C. It is easy to clean and stain resistant. It is non-porous, so it won't draw in moisture or bacteria and does not require sealing.

**Quartz is perfect for you if you want a durable countertop that can either mimic natural stone and/or achieve a uniform appearance to hide seams and requires minimal maintenance.**
