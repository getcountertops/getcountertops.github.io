<p class="h3">The engineered beauty thats got everybody talking.</p>

A quartz countertop is an engineered stone; it looks like stone, but you have the flexibility of man-made materials. Generally a combination of 93% quartz and 7% resin is used to create the hard, rock-like surface.

It is manufactured in a variety of different pattern and color combinations for a uniform appearance, so seams are easier to hide than in natural stone. We offer custom mitered edges for quartz countertops.

Quartz is the most durable. Easy to clean and stain resistant. It is non-porous, so it won't draw in moisture or bacteria and does not require sealing.

**Quartz is perfect for you if you want a durable countertop that has a uniform appearance and requires minimal maintenance.**
