Cultured marble is much like traditional solid surfaces, but it resembles natural marble stone and comes with a high-glossy finish.

We fabricate cultured marble bathroom vanity tops, which can come with a integral backsplash and molded sink. Cultured marble is not available for kitchen countertops.

Cultured marble is a great material for window sills and thresholds, which we also fabricate.

Cultured marble is easy to clean and stain resistant. It is non-porous, so it won't draw in moisture or bacteria and does not require sealing.

Cultured marble can develop scratches and scorching, but can also be restored with polishing and sanding, which is not possible with damaged natural or engineered stone.
