Granite one of the hardest natural stones on earth. It is an igneous rock composed chiefly of feldspar, and quartz. Each granite countertop is one-of-a-kind, with beautiful, naturally-occurring patterns and colors. For this reason, seams will be visible, especially if the stone has veins or directional movement. We offer custom mitered edges for some types of granite.

Granite is heavy and highly durable; it is hard to scratch or chip and has the highest tolerance for direct heat: up to 392&deg;F / 200&deg;C.

The natural stone does require special maintenance. It is porous and needs to be sealed before use and resealed at least every year to prevent water damage or staining.

**Granite is perfect for you if you want a durable countertop with unique, natural beauty, and you do not mind occasional maintenance duties.**

No two stone slabs are alike. To avoid any surprises, we suggest making an appointment to view the entire slab at the stone yard to make the perfect selection.
