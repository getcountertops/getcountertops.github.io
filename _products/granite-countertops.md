<p class="h3">The natural beauty thats got everybody talking.</p>

A granite countertop is a natural stone slab cut and polished into shape. It has beautiful naturally occurring patterns and colors that are truely unique, non-uniform appearance. This can make hiding seams more difficult. We offer custom mitered edges for some granite countertops.

Granite is heavy and highly durable; it is hard to scratch or chip and has the highest tolerance for direct heat (up to 392F/200C). The natural stone does require special maintenance. It is porous and needs to be sealed before use and resealed at least every year, and can only be stain resistant if properly maintained.

**Granite is perfect for you if you want a countertop that has a unique appearance and do not mind occasional maintenance duties.**
